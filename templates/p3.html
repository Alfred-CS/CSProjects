<p>I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street.</p> 
<p>My name is Patrick Bateman. </p> 
<p> I'm 27 years old.</p>  
<p>I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine.</p>
<p>In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. </p>
<p>I can do a thousand now. </p>
<p>After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. </p>
<p>In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. </p>
<p>Then a honey almond body scrub. </p>
<p>And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. </p>
<p>Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. </p>
<p>I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. </p>
<p>Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. </p>
<p>There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. </p>
<p>Only an entity, something illusory. </p>
<p>And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, </p>
<p>I simply am not there.</p>
